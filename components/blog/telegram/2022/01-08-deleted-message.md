Just a bug or real new Telegram feature ?  
  
Those screenshots are showing the text "Deleted message" (the one with *Support* belongs to a chat, the one with *Z* belongs to a channel)  
  
For the channel case, we can think that the owner sends "Deleted message", I mean why not this being intentional. But if it would be the case on the chat, we would see the Username above (or, we don't see)  
  
Screenshots taken on latest beta of Telegram X - Android. Reported to them, waiting for a responseâ€¦
