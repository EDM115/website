#storytime So, as you saw, yesterday I passed a kind of stress test to my bot.  
Here's the results : 150 downloads of mp3 in 1h15  
When the bot is overused, it still download fast. BUT the upload speeds are way reduced (as you can see [here](https://t.me/youtube_download_audio_video/3432), 5 upload in a row :sob:)  
  
Now, I'll try to fix this. Thanks for your support and your patience :pray::heart:
