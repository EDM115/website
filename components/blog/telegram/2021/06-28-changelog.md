#changelog : new in 2.0  
Hell yeah, we move on a new version :partying_face:  
So 1st, speed is always improved, but… that's not the most interesting…  
This major update have a brand new functionality : you're now able to download restricted videos :smirk::point_right:  
Means that you can download videos normally unavailable for you (i.e. because you need to have +18 or it's restricted for your country).  
Also, I'm working for a bug fix : currently, if you download a video in portrait format (i.e. Shorts) in MKV format, it will be downloaded as paysage… :man_facepalming: But no problem for MP4.  
I'm also working on YT premium content (like movies), private, and deleted videos.  
  
Enjoy :kissing_heart:
