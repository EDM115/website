#changelog : new in 2.5  
Major changes :  
  
• You can't download a video if it's content is owned by a company that have defined the video as *"you need rights to see it, bla bla bla…"* It's not due to me, but it's a restriction of yt-dl :disappointed_relieved:  
• ADDED **SUPPORT OF PLAYLISTS** ! (well, actually no but yes)  
Sending a playlist link will return a message with links of all videos inside the playlist. Then you still need to copy-paste those links and send them to the bot. But at least it works :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
