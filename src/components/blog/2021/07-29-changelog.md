#changelog : new in 2.2  
It's been a long time without updates.  
I apologize. I were very busy, and would probably be busy as well for next months :nerd_face:  
  
So, basically the servers are updated, and we have now more bandwidth :relieved:  
Means that the bot can now handle 15 parallel downloads  
And speed improved, as usual :rocket:  
  
Enjoy :kissing_heart:
