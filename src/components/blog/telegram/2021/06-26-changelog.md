#changelog : new in 1.2  
Bot is back to its normal speed :partying_face: Sorry for the inconvenience, but YouTube has changed the way they provide videos from their CDN's. I found a solution, but idk for how long, so maybe it's temporary and we'll have slow speed thenâ€¦  
The good news is the OFFICIAL SUPPORT OF SHORTS ! You can now download Shorts as well as videos :innocent:
