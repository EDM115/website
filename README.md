## Plan on the `redesign` branch

- Complete redesign
- Vue 3 + Vite + Vuetify (probably)
- Drop of Bootstrap (and most libraries)
- Dark theme
- Usage of the Dracula color scheme if possible
- Modern feel, glassy interface
- Custom cursor on few elements
- Reloadless transitions between pages
- Holographic card effect on my logo
- Breadcrumb
- Working contact form
- Simple colors
- Animate on scroll
- Responsive
- Fast to load
- Not too fancy
- Showcase of my projects
- B&W water filling animation
- Glow
- Neon
- A bunch of stuff I obviously don't handle well but just to show that "eh I can use that bro ðŸ¤“" and flex on poor souls visiting my website
- It's 2 AM, what are you expecting here ?

<summary>The boilerplate</summary>

## The boilerplate

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
