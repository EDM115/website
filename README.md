# website
Basically my website, hosted at [edm115.dev](https://edm115.dev) ([edm115.eu.org](https://edm115.eu.org) is a backup, real-time preview of the latest commit at [edm115.netlify.app](https://edm115.netlify.app))

[![DeepSource](https://app.deepsource.com/gh/EDM115/website.svg/?label=active+issues&show_trend=true&token=N0wq5KKIR-8bZ-Jsa88xTbRm)](https://app.deepsource.com/gh/EDM115/website/)

## Plan

- Complete redesign âœ…
- Vue 3 + Vite + Vuetify âœ…
- Drop of Bootstrap (and most libraries) âœ…
- Dark theme âœ…
- Usage of the Dracula color scheme if possible âœ…
- Modern feel, glassy interface
- Custom cursor on few elements
- Reloadless transitions between pages âœ…
- Holographic card effect on my logo
- Breadcrumb
- Working contact form
- Simple colors âœ…
- Animate on scroll
- Responsive
- Fast to load âœ…
- Not too fancy âœ…
- Showcase of my projects
- B&W water filling animation on load ?
- Glow
- Neon
- A bunch of stuff I obviously don't handle well but just to show that "eh I can use that bro ðŸ¤“" and flex on poor souls visiting my website
- It's 2 AM, what are you expecting here ?
- ...
- It have to act as a portfolio (showcase of my projects, my skills, my experiences, etc.) and a blog (where I can share my thoughts, my projects, etc.)

Have a look at [next.edm115.dev](https://next.edm115.dev) for a preview of the new website (rebuilt and updated as I can)
