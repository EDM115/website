Regarding to this, i **don't** know if I can continue my projects  
the bots will probably go down for some time, excepting if we found a solution in the next weeks  
I will still work hard to provide you the best experience possible, but it *may* be possible that on 28th November, my services will be stopped  
We could criticize Heroku as much as we want, but it was a golden platform with actually a lot of stuff for free. Like, which company would offer a 500 Gb disk ?

I'm also thinking about self-hosting the bots, but the workload may not be compatible with what I can do

It's a R.I.P for the moment, and maybe it will be a oof later
