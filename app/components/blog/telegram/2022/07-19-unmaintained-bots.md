From **today**  
bots will become `unmaintained`

They will still work (normally), but don't expect from me to fix bugs/add things

I'm with my gf for 2 weeks, and I seriously wanna enjoy being with her 🥹

You can still [PM](https://t.me/EDM115) me, but answers will be delayed

Thanks for your understanding, I'll come back stronger for August ❤‍🔥
