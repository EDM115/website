**Tutorial : How to change thumbnail/name of a telegram file**

2) Send the thumbnail you want to add, then reply to it with `/addthumb` (if you want to remove the thumbnail of a file, send `/delthumb`)
3) Forward the file (it can also be a direct link, like `https://test.com/file.zip`, but <ins>not</ins> like `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1r9kXzZkZ_cFZVJ6W42QrAb9AirsLKb76&export=download`)
4) If you just want to change the thumbnail, click on üñºÔ∏è button. If you *also* want to rename it, click on üñºÔ∏è‚úèÔ∏è
5) If you wanted to rename it, send the new filename to the bot when it asks it (pay attention, include the extension)
6) It's done ü•≥ Regardless of the file, pretty fast (DL around 6-10 Mb/s ‚Ä¢ UL around 25-30 Mb/s) and ~~it works for premium files ü•∞~~ (lol i don't have premium acc ü•≤)
