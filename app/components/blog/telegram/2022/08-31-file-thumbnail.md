[26/09] ~~THAT BOT DOWN UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE~~

[15/10] YOU CAN USE THAT FEATURE IN THE MAIN BOT [@unzip_edm115bot](https://t.me/unzip_edm115bot)


`New feature of v5 • Available for testing`

**Tutorial : How to change thumbnail/name of a telegram file**

1) Start [@unzipbetatestbot](https://t.me/unzipbetatestbot)
2) Send the thumbnail you want to add, then reply to it with `/addthumb` (if you want to remove the thumbnail of a file, send `/delthumb`)
3) Forward the file (it can also be a direct link, like `https://test.com/file.zip`, but ++not++ like `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1r9kXzZkZ_cFZVJ6W42QrAb9AirsLKb76&export=download`)
4) If you just want to change the thumbnail, click on :framed_picture: button. If you *also* want to rename it, click on :framed_picture::pencil2:
5) If you wanted to rename it, send the new filename to the bot when it asks it (pay attention, include the extension)
6) It's done :partying_face: Regardless of the file, pretty fast (DL around 6-10 Mb/s • UL around 25-30 Mb/s) and ~~it works for premium files :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:~~ (lol i don't have premium acc :smiling_face_with_tear:)
