**Thank you everyone for the 200 users on [@unzip_edm115bot](https://t.me/unzip_edm115bot) 🥳❤️**
This give me enough motivation to keep that bot updated, among my other projects (and my holidays 🤓)

🤍 As a reward, here is a ~~small~~ update : **a little preview of the v5**
The development will be *pretty long*, so here’s what I did yet :
```
• Better thumbnail management
• Correct uptime on stats
• Updated to Python 3.10 and Pyrogram 2
• Changing from "upload as video" to "upload as media" 👇
• Uploading photos, videos and audios as media by default (database have been manually updated)
• Now we can do other things while extracting (like help or stats)
• Upload progressbar
• Can handle premium files
• Better password processing
```

Here are only few things from the [v5](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/issues/38) 🫢

<ins>Keep supporting me !</ins> ❤‍🔥
