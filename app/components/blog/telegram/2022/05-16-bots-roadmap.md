**Roadmap (part 2) :**

• [@AllDownloaderbyedm115_bot](https://t.me/AllDownloaderbyedm115_bot) ~~will be shut down in 2-3 days~~ shut down now  
Decision is personal. Plus, no one will cry on that

• [@ytdl_byedm115_backupbot](https://t.me/ytdl_byedm115_backupbot) will stay buggy as it is, plus support out of the group won't be provided

• [@unzip_edm115bot](https://t.me/unzip_edm115bot) I'm working on v4  
Already implemented a small update (everyone mistakenly banned is unbanned + `/mode` works correctly)

• Other projets will come after
