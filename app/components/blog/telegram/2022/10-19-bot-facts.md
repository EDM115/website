++Time for some facts :++

• We have crushed **650** users  
• We have processed **+6k** archives so far, for an amount of **9,5 Tb**  
• Every hour, we process **3~5** more Gigabytes of data  
• **38%** of the archives contains a password. This functionality being not that much used, I may missed some bugs so if you find some, be sure to report them in [@EDM115_chat](https://t.me/EDM115_chat)  
• Rename/change file thumbnail feature have been used less than **100** times  
• **23%** of the archives we process come from links. In case bot gets stuck on downloading, [@transload](https://t.me/transload) it first (https://eu-amsterdam.rapidleech.gq is a good one)

++Now, let's do a little FAQ :++

*• Why I can't send multiple archives at the same time ?*  
Because that's a current limitation. Working to remove it but it will need a lot of code changes  
*• Why I can't extract splitted archives (.part×.rar, .001, …) ?*  
Once again, that's a limitation. May become available in the next month  
*• Why the bot can't send files above 2 Gb ?*  
I work hard on that but don't remind it to me (excepting if you wanna make me cry :smiling_face_with_tear:)  
*• Will the bot continue to work after 28th November ?*  
Maybe, maybe not. It will depend of what I can do and how much I have to spend on it (refer to [this](https://t.me/EDM115bots/156) if you can donate :pleading_face:)

++Finally, just some basic rules :++

• STOP sending twice the *exact same* archive in a row. It won't do anything, excepting giving you an error. Next person doing that will earn a warn :angry:  
*• Is there any content forbidden with this bot ?* (question been asked by several users)  
No, there's no real restrictions. Unzip music, courses material, malwares, illegal things, pørn, … I don't care about that. THE ONLY FORBIDDEN THING is !!ch¡ld pørn!!. If I catch someone unzipping such content, he's going to be banned forever :rage:  
• I wanna appeal from a ban :melting_face:  
Send a request in [@EDM115_chat](https://t.me/EDM115_chat)

That being said, feel free to use and abuse this bot while you can. Further development will come in 7 days  
Have a nice day :relaxed: and subscribe to [@EDM115bots](https://t.me/EDM115bots) for giving me motivation :kissing_heart:
