Problems, part 69 :  
Touchpad started to stop working. Pretty bad, but I managed to enable it again (after 30min, I reinstalled an old driver from the computer. This seems to be the actual solution from Microsoft, as Lenovo doesn't provides the driver)

BUT AFTER A RESTART, it's now the keyboard which doesn't work 🥲 they seems to be linked in some way, however this time I struggle to make it working back…

fck day

*edit :* uninstalling W11 22H2 update
