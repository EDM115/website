**:warning: HUGE CHANGES • READ CAREFULLY :warning:**

*Everything have to come to an end they say… Don't take your dreams for the reality, they say…*

On 25th August 2022, Heroku [announced](https://t.me/EDM115bots/140) the end of their free plans and so, the end of an incalculable number of bots and other projects  
By that time, I thought that this bot would go down, but…  
**IN FACTS NO ! :star_struck:**

Thanks to my school being partner with GitHub, and thanks to Heroku making student's free stuff, I can proudly announce you that we will be able to use the bot for **1 more year :partying_face:**

*BUT*, this will imply some changes :

• The bot now will restart only once per day (instead of 2) at specific hour  
• So it means 1 instance for the bot, night time will no longer hold the newest changes  
• :no_entry_sign: The beta test bot ([@unzipbetatestbot](https://t.me/unzipbetatestbot)) is shut down, so stop using it. It will now only be run manually by me when I need to test changes before pushing them to the production stage  
• **:construction: From 28th November to 1st December**, the bot will be **DOWN :construction:** No requests will be served, and you won't be able to use it in any way. I'm very sorry for that, but it will allow you to be able to use it 1 more month :wink: You will get a message 30mins before it's shut down, so if you receive it, don't process any file  
• Because we can still host it, I will continue to provide updates (I admit I've lost a bit of motivation). Maybe you will get a surprise on 1st December :shushing_face:… who knows :shushing_face:  
• [Rules](https://t.me/EDM115bots/222) stays the rules, don't mess up with them :rotating_light:

*Now*, few announcements :

• Thanks for 1069 users :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: The number of users grows very rapidly but we still are able to handle your requests  
• If you have a problem, [fill an issue](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/issues). If you think you can solve a problem/make an improvement, [pull requests are welcome](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/pulls)  
• By the end of 2023, we may run only thanks to donations :pleading_face: I know you guys still have one year, but if you can, [donate](https://t.me/EDM115bots/156) so we can continue this adventure  
• If anyone have telegram premium and can donate a session string, the bot would be able to upload files up to 4 Gb :slightly_smiling_face: Not forcing anyone (and I still need to know how to implement this), but any help is appreciated

Thank you all for reading all of this, I love you :face_holding_back_tears::heart_on_fire:
