custom Steam instances of FH5 & FH4 were clashing  
so uninstalled them  
will do a cleaning then installing FH one by one. installing the next only when I have finished the current one  
so will install FH3 on next week  
only game remaining is WD_1, that's a long time I wanted to play it and it doesn't disappoints me  
vehicles damages are way farther than in Cyberpunk 2077 :joy:
