![disk-shortage](/img/blog/2022/11-16-disk-shortage.webp)  
today was a hard day for the bot  
while (usually) it restarts only twice a day (5h and 21h UTC+1 Paris), today it restarted more than 30 times  
the load was so high that it threw an awesome error : running out of the 500 Gb storage :smiling_face_with_tear:  
at first I thought it was only due to [the Dyno incident](https://status.heroku.com/incidents/2468), but from the logs, it turns out that no

also since its launch, the bot have processed +10k files :partying_face:

regarding to : will it continue to run after 28th November, the answer is : I may have found a workaround  
for yet another year  
but it may imply 2 days off. will keep you up to date  
(btw we are close to 1k users… :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:)
