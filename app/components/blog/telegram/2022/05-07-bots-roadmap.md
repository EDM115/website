<u>REGARDING TO MY BOTS (huge changes) :pleading_face::broken_heart:</u>  
  
Let me give you the roadmap :  
  
• [@ytvideodownloaderbyedm115_bot](https://t.me/ytvideodownloaderbyedm115_bot) is shut down  
The recent upload problems are yet another reason for me to do it  
The [promised update](https://t.me/EDM115bots/51) will come, but seriously later than expected :smiling_face_with_tear: as I have too much work for now  
I no longer provide any support for the old code. It have moved to [@ytdl_byedm115_backupbot](https://t.me/ytdl_byedm115_backupbot), and you can still [use it in the group](https://t.me/youtube_download_audio_video)  
You can run your own version through webhook by running the following command : `@ytdl_byedm115_backupbot clone {BOT_TOKEN}` where {BOT_TOKEN} is what you got from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)  
  
• Regarding to [@AllDownloaderbyedm115_bot](https://t.me/AllDownloaderbyedm115_bot)  
Same, going to be discontinued. Code will no longer be updated, so it will stay bugged as it is :broken_heart:  
As Google is shutting down Team Drives, it's useless  
Plus, the OAuth provider will [end support](https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/02/making-oauth-flows-safer.html?m=1#disallowed-oob) in October 2022, so yeah  
Bot will become offline at 1st September 2022 and will be deleted at this date  
  
• The brand new [@unzip_edm115bot](https://t.me/unzip_edm115bot) will stay updated and will continuously get new features as the time passes  
Once it will be done and fully stable, I'll start making something else  
  
  
Much love :pleading_face:
