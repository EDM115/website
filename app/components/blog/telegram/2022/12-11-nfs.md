so  
on Black Friday, i bought officially NFS Payback and Heat  
so here are my thoughts after few play hours on each of them :

• Payback seems to have a better story. Something more written, more "realistic"  
• Heat let you choose the main chara, and that's cool (I've chosen the redhead with that bra because… why not changing). However I also like the 3 chara change on Payback  
• Customization of the numberplate while offline is lacking on both  
• Heat handles better accidents  
• I love Heat’s glitch effects :heart_eyes:  
• Despite the fact that I don't like rap/trap/and so on, BO of Heat seems better, more diversified. but we can't change the playing song  
• Sound is more balanced in Payback  
• On low quality, Heat struggles to display everything (probably because it's more detailed)  
• Load times are equivalent  
• Gamma on Heat is… too saturated :neutral_face: hard to see on full sun  
• Maps are correct. And Heat’s one is splitted in 2, so we can't drive anywhere (yet)  
• That day/night scheme of Heat is cool, but harder to handle than on Payback (because you need to think about turning into Night for reputation, etc). So no day/night legit cycle  
• Better damages realism on Heat (colliding somewhere finally have a result)  
• Heat have overall better graphics and effects  
• Police is deadly blind on both :man_with_probing_cane:  
• Nitro management is more punitive on Heat

But yeah, both are very cool, i recommend them definitely :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
