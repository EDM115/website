Heyo
here is a little tutorial to fix an error on the bot

Maybe you already noticed it, but sometimes, clicking "Upload All ðŸ“¤" doesn't upload everything

in such case, wait 2min. if nothing else have been uploaded, or the progress bar is dead, scroll up and click "Upload All ðŸ“¤" again
do it as much time as needed (until "Successfully uploaded âœ…" appears)

why this happens ?
â€¢ Changing of folder
â€¢ FloodWait error from Telegram that I badly handle ðŸ¥²

*fixed*
