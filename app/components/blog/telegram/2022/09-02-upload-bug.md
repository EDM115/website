Heyo  
here is a little tutorial to fix an error on the bot

Maybe you already noticed it, but sometimes, clicking "Upload All 📤" doesn't upload everything

in such case, wait 2min. if nothing else have been uploaded, or the progress bar is dead, scroll up and click "Upload All 📤" again  
do it as much time as needed (until "Successfully uploaded ✅" appears)

why this happens ?  
• Changing of folder  
• FloodWait error from Telegram that I badly handle 🥲

*fixed*
