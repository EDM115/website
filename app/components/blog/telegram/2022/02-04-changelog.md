#ytdlbot #changelog : new in 2.6.2  
Minor changes :

• Fixed a bug where captions of 2 downloads are switched (whatever the chat/group or time of uploading)
It already happened hundred times since the launching of the bot, but it happened more frequently the 2 last weeks…  
Normally, it's fixed now, but it may still occur sometimes :sweat_smile:  
• Upgraded stability
