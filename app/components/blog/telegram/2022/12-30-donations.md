And if you wonder, i actually received !!0,00$!! from donations :partying_face::face_in_clouds:  
so some users told me "why don't you enable paid ads ? or a paid version ?" I say **no** and **no**, and I'll explain why :  
I won't make paid ads, because I don't want my users to be disturbed by things they don't want/like  
and I won't make a paid plan, even if it can bring new things (uploads up to 4Gb, prioritizing, whatever it can be) because the bot is and will stay free :smiling_face_with_three_hearts: (unless we technically can't)
