Latest beta commits have been pushed to the night beta version of the bot (read the description of the bot to know more about this)

**Running the v5.1.2**

This one have permanent thumbnail support and rename file ability  
oh and also [this](https://t.me/EDM115bots/158) have been fixed  
and much more but I'm lazy to leak everything

Give feedback on [@EDM115_chat](https://t.me/EDM115_chat) if you face any problems/have feature requests

on the next weeks, I'll push updates on that night version (split files, multiple task processing, telling you when it restarted while processing a task, …)

so see ya :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
