Massive error currently happening :

`Telegram says: [400 Bad Request] - [400 ENTITY_BOUNDS_INVALID] (caused by "messages.SendMessage")`

Bot isn't able to process any file
Problem seems on side of Telegram
it raises that exceptions that doesn't even exist on PyroGram Docs

will investigate on this, but until I tell you "it's okay", don't send files here as it will not work

Thanks for your understanding ðŸ¥º
