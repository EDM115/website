#changelog : new in 0.9  
Last round until moving out from beta :relieved: Bot is still more stable, also I noticed that when I tried to upload 8K HDR video, the problem didn't came from bot or YouTube CDN but from Telegram itself :smiling_face_with_tear: apparently they're unable to handle thisâ€¦ So I still wait for an update from their side
