#changelog : new in 2.3  
One of the last updates, but who cares ? :slightly_smiling_face:

• Upload and download bugs are fixed since some days and the beta of 2.3, enjoy  
• Non-responding bot bug is fixed  
• Better handling for errors :
- It says to retry if an unknown error is occured
- `LIVE_STREAM_OFFLINE` code for videos still not premiered
- `LOGIN_REQUIRED` code for private videos
- `ERROR` code for deleted videos

Enjoy :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
