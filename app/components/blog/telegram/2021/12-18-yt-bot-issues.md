You think [bot](https://t.me/ytvideodownloaderbyedm115_bot) is **down ?**  
Well, it's **not** ! Just facing some issues… :skull:  
  
<u>Symptoms :</u>  
• Answer time might be delayed from 1s to ≈3-4s  
• Upload time is way longer (nearly 4×)  
• Download and merging time is unchanged  
  
<u>Why this happens ?</u>  
First, we got some server issues :disappointed_relieved:  
Then, we're close to Christmas, and the number of requests were multiplied by 12 in just a week :flushed:  
So of course, it's harder for us to handle all of them  
  
<u>How to fix it ?</u>  
The main solution is to wait… That's the better thing to do  
If you waited more than 15mins, send once again the link to the bot, and choose *exactly* the same quality/format than previously. It will just restart the upload from where it stopped (because yes, due to high demand, the bot can sometimes *"forget"* your upload on the stack… :smiling_face_with_tear: So just reminds him gently that you're waiting for your file, and he will complete the upload :relaxed:)  
  
Thanks for your understanding :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
