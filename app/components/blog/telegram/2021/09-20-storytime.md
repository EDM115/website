#storytime yep  
So, *WHY the bot was acting weirdly those days ?*  
Lemme explain you. Some ~~dumbass~~ *stupid users* think that they can "kill" the bot (or our servers) by sending a loooot of requests…

I must say one thing :  
**FLOOD / SPAM IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN !!!**

What is that ?  
Spamming, is sending a lot of requests that have nothing to do with my bot. By security, the bot never reply to an URL that is NOT from YouTube.  
Flooding, is sending too many requests that the bot CAN'T handle. Like downloading 200 videos in 8K at the same time (this happened just today… :cold_sweat:). The bot actually have a kind of cooldown, don't worry… :relieved:

**From now, every user that flood/spam is definitely banned from using the bot. Thanks for understanding** :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
