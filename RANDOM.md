It's worth noting that all these tools are capable, and the best choice often depends on your familiarity, the project's requirements, and personal preference.

**Vite** (French for "fast") is a build tool and development server that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It was created by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, but it is framework agnostic and can be used with other frameworks and libraries like React, Svelte, etc.

**Features**:
1. **Native ES Modules**: Unlike traditional bundlers, Vite serves your source code to the browser with native ES modules during development, which allows for fast cold server starts and instant hot module replacement (HMR).
  
2. **Rich Features Out of the Box**: Vite provides built-in features like CSS pre-processing, image optimization, and more, without requiring additional plugins.

3. **Plugin System**: Based on Rollup plugins, it allows extending the build process easily.

4. **Optimized Builds**: For production, Vite uses Rollup to bundle your code, benefiting from Rollup's tree-shaking capabilities.

5. **Framework Agnostic**: While initially built around Vue, Vite offers templates and support for other frameworks like React, Svelte, etc.

**Pros**:
1. **Speed**: Due to its use of native ES modules, Vite offers near-instantaneous server starts and module updates.
  
2. **Simplified Configuration**: Its configuration is often seen as simpler and more intuitive than tools like Webpack.

3. **Integrated Build System**: By leveraging Rollup for production builds, Vite offers optimized output with minimal configuration.

**Cons**:
1. **Newer Tool**: Being relatively newer, some workflows and integrations might not be as battle-tested as with older bundlers/tools like Webpack.
  
2. **Compatibility**: Because Vite relies on ES modules, older browsers that don't support ES modules are not directly supported during development.

**When to Consider Vite**:
1. **Modern Development**: If you're targeting modern browsers and want a fast, streamlined development experience.
  
2. **Vue Projects**: While Vite is framework agnostic, Vue projects can benefit directly from the creator's consistent vision between Vue and Vite.

3. **Migrating from Other Tools**: If you're frustrated with the complexities or performance of other build tools, Vite might offer a refreshing alternative.

In summary, Vite offers a modern development experience optimized for speed and simplicity. It's an exciting tool for developers who want to stay on the cutting edge of web development tooling.
