					How to Install ?

The easy way (recommended) :

- Download the CurseForge App (https://download.curseforge.com/) and install it. If you are on Windows, I recomment Curseforge on Overwolf
- Go here : https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/edm115s-enhanced-experience/files
- On the latest version, the one at the top (don't pick the legacy file !), click on the Install with CurseForge app orange button
- Everything is automatic ! Once it's done, right-click on the modpack, click Open folder, and on the mods folder, copy paste the following files from that archive :
  - OptiFine-1.19_HD_U_H9.jar
  - tl_skin_cape_forge_1.19-1.26.jar
  (the files are also available here : https://edm115.dev/external-mods)
- Launch the profile (play) and skip to Step 4


The (less) easy way (still recommended) :

- Download and install a third-party launcher (here we use ATLauncher : https://atlauncher.com/downloads)
- Go in instances, click on Modrinth and search for "EDM115"
- Click New instance and wait for everything to download
- Go on the Instances tab and click Play on the EDM115 instance and skip to Step 4


The legacy way (if you play through TLauncher, or if you want more control) :

Step 1 : Install Forge 41.1.0 (made for Minecraft 1.19), the file is included (forge-1.19-41.1.0-installer.jar). Choose "Install client", and let it do the job
/!\ If you already have forge installed (and if it's another version), maybe the easy way is for you. Because if you want to re-connect to servers that uses another version of forge, you will need to reinstall it every time ! (and make saves) Backup your mods and config folder in such case !

Step 2 : copy all the files here into %appdata%/.minecraft
/!\ If it prompts to "replace files", DON'T ! It will most likely concern config files. I included them so you can experience the exact same gameplay while creating a solo world, however if you already configured some of the mods, better not to overwrite your config

Step 3 : Run Minecraft Launcher (or TLauncher, anything you like). Among the profiles (where you can select the game version), choose forge-41.1.0 (1.19) or a mention like this one. If you need help about installing Forge on TLauncher, YouTube is here for you
/!\ TLauncher REAL address is tlaun.ch, DON'T FALL IN tlauncher.org SCAM !!!

Step 4 : Click Play and wait for the assets to download. Go on Options, Resources packs, and enable, in the following order :
  - Dracula UI
  - Default Dark Mode
  - Visible Ores
  - Mods resources
  - Minecraft

Step 5 : Go in Multiplayer, add a new server and enter the following infos :
Name : Anything you like
Adress : minecraft.edm115.dev:37730 (as a fallback, you can enter EDM115.aternos.me:37730)

If the server is marked as "offline", PM me on Telegram (@EDM115) or WhatsApp (+33667980504). DON'T TRY TO CONNECT DURING THE SERVER LAUNCH, it will only make the launch longer !
